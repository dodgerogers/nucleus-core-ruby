## Overview

Nucleus Core provides a framework-agnostic foundation for encapsulating domain logic enabling seamless integration across various platforms and mediums.

It prescribes that a request is broken down as follows:

#### 1. Device
- Receives request  

---

#### 2. Framework
- Formats request parameters and passes them to a receiver  

---

#### 3. Nucleus
- Authenticate & Authorize (if applicable)
- Execute an operation or workflow  
- Interact with data via a repository  
- Return a view object  

---

#### 4. Framework
- Renders the view object in the requested format  

---

#### 5. Device
- Displays the output to the medium it serves  

---

## Getting started

1. Install the gem

```ruby
gem install 'nucleus-core'
```

2. Initialize and configure

```ruby
require "nucleus-core"

NucleusCore.configure do |config|
  config.logger = Logger.new($stdout)
  config.default_response_format = :json # defaults to :json
  # The request_exceptions attribute allows you to define custom exception handling for different
  # HTTP error types. The keys are standard error names like :bad_request, :unauthorized, and :not_found,
  # and the values are the exception classes or errors you want to handle for each case.
  config.request_exceptions = {
    not_found: RecordNotFound,
    unprocessible: [RecordInvalid, RecordNotSaved],
    bad_request: ArgumentError,
    forbidden: NotPermittedError,
    unauthorized: UnAuthenticatedError
  }
end
```

3. Refer to the [how to](HOW-TO.md) section for guidance on writing business logic.
