## Overview

Modern applications often blur the line between business logic and framework concerns, making them harder to maintain, test, and extend.

Nucleus Core solves this by providing a framework-agnostic foundation for structuring business logic. This means:
‚úÖ Your logic remains portable, working seamlessly across different frameworks.
‚úÖ Testing becomes easier, with no dependency on a specific web stack.
‚úÖ Your codebase is more maintainable, with clear separation of concerns.

Instead of letting the framework dictate how your business logic runs, Nucleus Core defines a structured flow that keeps your application modular and adaptable.

## üîç **How Nucleus Core Works**  

Every request‚Äîwhether from a web app, an API call, a mobile device, or a CLI‚Äîfollows a **structured five-step process** to **ensure clarity, modularity, and adaptability** across different systems.  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Device (User or External System Initiates a Request)**  
üì° A request is made‚Äîthis could be:  
- A **user clicking a button** on a website.  
- A **mobile app fetching data** from an API.  
- A **system sending a webhook** to another service.  
- A **CLI command requesting an operation**.  

At this stage, the **raw request is created** and sent to the system.  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Framework (Receives & Parses the Request)**  
üîç The framework (e.g., Rails, Sinatra, a custom API gateway, or any other system) **processes the request**:  
- **Extracts** relevant parameters (e.g., URL params, headers, body data).  
- **Applies middleware** (e.g., logging, request validation).  
- **Passes the formatted request** to the business logic layer.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Nucleus Core (Processes the Business Logic)**  
üõ† **The core engine of your application executes the request**:  
- **Authenticates & authorizes** (if required).  
- **Executes an operation or workflow** (e.g., fetching data, updating a record, triggering an event).  
- **Generates a structured response** in the form of a **view object**, ensuring consistent output.  

This is where the real **business logic happens**‚Äîseparated from any framework concerns.  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Framework (Formats & Renders the Response)**  
üé® The framework **receives the structured response** from Nucleus Core and:  
- **Formats it** according to the requested output (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML, or plaintext).  
- **Applies additional transformations** (e.g., adding pagination metadata, compressing data).  
- **Sends the final formatted response** back to the requesting device.  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Device (Receives & Displays the Response)**  
üì≤ The **response is rendered in an appropriate format**:  
- A **web browser displays an HTML page**.  
- A **mobile app updates its UI** with new data.  
- A **server processes the response** from an API call.  
- A **CLI prints the result** to the terminal.  

---

### **üîπ Why This Matters**  
By structuring requests in this way, **your business logic stays clean, portable, and reusable**, while frameworks handle only the **transport and rendering of data**.  

This **clear separation of concerns** allows Nucleus Core to:  
‚úÖ Work **seamlessly across different frameworks and platforms**.  
‚úÖ Keep business logic **independent of the transport layer**.  
‚úÖ Ensure **predictable, structured, and testable** responses.

## Getting started

1. Install the gem

```ruby
gem install 'nucleus-core'
```

2. Initialize `NucleusCore`

```ruby
require "nucleus-core"

NucleusCore.configure do |config|
  config.logger = Logger.new($stdout)
  config.default_response_format = :xml # defaults to :json
  # The request_exceptions attribute allows you to define custom exception handling for different
  # HTTP error types. The keys are standard error names like :bad_request, :unauthorized, and :not_found,
  # and the values are the exception classes or errors you want to handle for each case.
  config.request_exceptions = {
    not_found: RecordNotFound,
    unprocessible: [RecordInvalid, RecordNotSaved],
    bad_request: ArgumentError,
    forbidden: NotPermittedError,
    unauthorized: UnAuthenticatedError
  }
end
```
